    <h1 class="blue">Who was Frank Herbert?</h1>
    <p>
      Frank Herbert, (born October 8, 1920, Tacoma, Washington, U.S.—died February 11, 1986, Madison, Wisconsin), American science-fiction writer noted
       as the author of the best-selling Dune series of futuristic novels, a group of highly complex works that explore such themes as ecology, human evolution,
       the consequences of genetic manipulation, and mystical and psychic possibilities. Until 1972, when he began to write full-time, Herbert held a variety of
        jobs while writing socially engaged science fiction. He was working as a journalist when his reputation was made with the publication of the epic Dune (1965),
         which was translated into 14 languages and sold some 12 million copies, more than any other science-fiction book in history; ironically, Dune had been rejected
          by 20 publishers before it was published. An abortive film version was attempted in 1975 by Chilean-French director Alejandro Jodorowsky; that effort was
           chronicled in the documentary Jodorowsky’s Dune (2013). Dino De Laurentiis purchased the rights in 1976, and an adaptation was filmed by David Lynch (1984).
            A television miniseries aired in 2000, followed by another miniseries (2003) that covered the events in the second and third Dune books. In 2021 French Canadian
             director Denis Villeneuve released another film adaptation, which was based on the first half of Dune.
